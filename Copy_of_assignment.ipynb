        "\n",
        "**This paper addresses the lack of research in efficient data cleaning by discussing the usefulness of tidying datasets. The specific structure of tidy datasets- in which each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table- makes it easier to clean, manipulate, and analyze data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **The purpose of tidy data is to standardize the organization of datasets in a way that optimizes the data cleaning process.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Tidy datasets are alike because they all have a standardized organization, while the issues of messy datasets are distinct because the person that recorded the data did it in a way that's specific to their goal in collecting it. It is extremely difficult to define what exactly a 'variable' is in general due to the variety of domains or subject areas that data is collected for. However, observations are easier to define in a given dataset because it's a choice by the person creating the dataset on what that variable represents.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Values are qualitative or quantitative pieces of information, variables contain  values measuring the same attribute, and observations contain values that measure it across attributes.**\n",

        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Tidy data is one way to standardize the organization of a dataset in a way that the structure itself indicates its meaning, with each row representing an observation, each column representing a variable, and all observational units forming a table.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **The five most common issues with messy datasets include having values in the column headers instead of variable names, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables being stored in rows and columns, multiple types of observational units being stored in the same table, and a single observational unit being stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 are messy due to the column headers being numeric values instead of variable names. A solution to this issue would be 'melting' the dataset, which means turning the columns into rows.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Table 11 is messy because there are values stored in the column header instead of variable names. Table 12 (a) is molten because it took those values from the columns and turned them into rows, however one of the columns only contain the names of variables rather than values. The tidy dataset in Table 12 (b) has each row representing every observational unit, instead of variable names.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  **The tools that work with tidy data cannot be separated from the tidy data framework, making it hard for these tools to actually improve the data cleaning process as a whole. Wickham hopes that others will build on this framework or come up with new sets of tools to clean data more efficiently.**"
